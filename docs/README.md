# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This README serves as the entry point and navigation guide for all project management process documentation.

## How to Use These Docs

These documents capture OctoAcme's project management methodology, roles, and processes. Use them to:

- Onboard new team members quickly

## Project Management Process Overview

### Principles

OctoAcme projects are guided by these core principles:

- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback and learning

### Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a high-level lifecycle:

1. **Initiation:** Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning:** Scope work, allocate resources, set milestones, identify dependencies
3. **Execution & Tracking:** Build, test, review, iterate with regular standups and syncs
4. **Release & Deployment:** Deploy, verify, announce to stakeholders
5. **Risk Management & Communication:** Identify, assess, mitigate, and communicate risks throughout
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Team Rhythm / Cadence

- **Daily standups** (15 min) — focus on progress, blockers, dependencies
- **Weekly sync** between PM and Product Manager
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery team (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**
- **Demo/Review** at the end of each sprint or milestone
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed

### Key Artifacts

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers:** Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs and approvals
